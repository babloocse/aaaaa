        Today, <em>we’re going to be <strong>making a website</strong> about your favorite animal.</em> 
        <br>We’re going to be using Mozilla Thimble, <br>and we’ll be writing our website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        <br>No prior experience with web design or HTML is required. Let’s get started!

    <h1>STEP 0: HTML BASICS</h1>
    <!-- paragraph-->
    <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language we will be using to put the information on our pages such as a title, paragraph, list, etc. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
        <br>is what we are going to be using to style our pages by doing things like changing the color, centering the content, etc. We will be looking at some already written CSS code, 
        <br>but we will mostly be writing code in HTML today.
        <br>
        Before we begin coding our website, it is important that we learn the basis of all HTML: tags. There are four main things that you need to know about tags.
    </p>
    <ol strat="1">
        <li><h4>
            Every element has an opening and a closing tag
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            All tags have “< >” around them
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            All closing tags begin with a “/” inside the “<>”
        </h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>
            All closing tags match their opening tags
        </h4>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Each tag has a meaning associated with it. For instance, “h1” is the largest heading, “p” is a paragraph, and “ul” 
        <br>makes an unordered list (list with bullet points). You will learn more of these tags as we code our website today, 
        <br>and you can always look up more tag names at w3schools.com. When you are coding your website today, make sure that 
        <br>every element (title, heading, paragraph, list, etc.) has an opening and a closing tag that corresponds with it, otherwise 
        <br>your web page might not appear exactly how you want it to.
